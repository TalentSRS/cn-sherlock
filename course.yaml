  Chinese title is 卷发公司的案子.

  Mr. Xie was recently hired by the Curly Haired Company. For a significant
  weekly allowance, he was required to sit in an office and copy articles from a
  book, while in the meantime his assistant looked after his shop. He had
  answered an advertisement in the paper and although hundreds of people
  applied, he was the only one selected because of his very curly hair. When the
  company unexpectedly closes, Mr. Xie visits Gao Ming (Sherlock Holmes) with
  his strange story. Gao Ming is certain something is not right, but will he
  solve the mystery in time?
